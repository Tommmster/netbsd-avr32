	$NetBSD: TODO,v 1.4 2008/08/07 11:15:20 pooka Exp $

* fix the build structure to work better on non-NetBSD
* figure out how to handle mount parameters in fs-independent
  fashion (requires kernel changes)
* integrate build framework with config(1) to stop the need to
  maintain a separate build infrastructure
* dlopen libraries instead of linking where it makes sense
  + makes a difference for e.g. "fsconsole"
* support nfs (requires using the network stack in userspace)
* find a better solution for rumpdefs.h, the sed "solution"
  doesn't really scale nicely
* add support to vnode_if.sh to produce rumpvnode_if instead of sed'ing
