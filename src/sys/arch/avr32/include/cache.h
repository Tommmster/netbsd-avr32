/*
 * Cache operations.
 *
 * We define the following primitives:
 *
 * --- Instruction cache synchronization (mandatory):
 *
 *	icache_sync_all		Synchronize I-cache
 *
 *	icache_sync_range	Synchronize I-cache range
 *
 *	icache_sync_range_index	(index ops)
 *
 * --- Primary data cache (mandatory):
 *
 *	pdcache_wbinv_all	Write-back Invalidate primary D-cache
 *
 *	pdcache_wbinv_range	Write-back Invalidate primary D-cache range
 *
 *	pdcache_wbinv_range_index (index ops)
 *
 *	pdcache_inv_range	Invalidate primary D-cache range
 *
 *	pdcache_wb_range	Write-back primary D-cache range
 *
 * --- Secondary data cache (optional):
 *
 *	sdcache_wbinv_all	Write-back Invalidate secondary D-cache
 *
 *	sdcache_wbinv_range	Write-back Invalidate secondary D-cache range
 *
 *	sdcache_wbinv_range_index (index ops)
 *
 *	sdcache_inv_range	Invalidate secondary D-cache range
 *
 *	sdcache_wb_range	Write-back secondary D-cache range
 *
 * There are some rules that must be followed:
 *
 *	I-cache Synch (all or range):
 *		The goal is to synchronize the instruction stream,
 *		so you may need to write-back dirty data cache
 *		blocks first.  If a range is requested, and you
 *		can't synchronize just a range, you have to hit
 *		the whole thing.
 *
 *	D-cache Write-back Invalidate range:
 *		If you can't WB-Inv a range, you must WB-Inv the
 *		entire D-cache.
 *
 *	D-cache Invalidate:
 *		If you can't Inv the D-cache without doing a
 *		Write-back, YOU MUST PANIC.  This is to catch
 *		errors in calling code.  Callers must be aware
 *		of this scenario, and must handle it appropriately
 *		(consider the bus_dma(9) operations).
 *
 *	D-cache Write-back:
 *		If you can't Write-back without doing an invalidate,
 *		that's fine.  Then treat this as a WB-Inv.  Skipping
 *		the invalidate is merely an optimization.
 *
 *	All operations:
 *		Valid virtual addresses must be passed to the
 *		cache operation.
 *
 * Finally, these primitives are grouped together in reasonable
 * ways.  For all operations described here, first the primary
 * cache is frobbed, then the secondary cache frobbed, if the
 * operation for the secondary cache exists.
 *
 *	avr32_icache_sync_all	Synchronize I-cache
 *
 *	avr32_icache_sync_range	Synchronize I-cache range

 *
 *	avr32_dcache_wbinv_all	Write-back Invalidate D-cache
